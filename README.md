Task #1 for algorithmization

Create stack based 0on array/linked list and implement next functions:

create – create stack with number of elements;
push – add element to stack;
pop – get element from stack;
capacity – get amount of elements in stack;
size – maximum amount of elements.
Resize – increase/decrease size of stack.
In case of C++ stack must be implemented as class. In case C stack should be implemented as structure.
